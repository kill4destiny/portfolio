      <h4>Personal</h4>
      <div class="about-info">
        <p>My name is Luiz Matamoros, born in Houston,TX. Growing up I had great education, never missed school, and was always strict about behaving good. Until I got to highschool, everything changed. I had to start working to help my family with financial problems, and by the time I was a senior I dropped out of highschool to focus on working fulltime. Later on I moved to Rhode Island with my girlfriend and started working in construction. I found it fascinating how construction took place and how every detail had to be right so that houses could be stable and not come crashing down as years come. 6 years I've been working in this company and I have learned alot. On a winter day, I was working on a roof and when I was done I got ready to get down on the ladder, but as i put a step on the ladder, it slipped and i fell. Ended up going to the hospital, and got told i had fractured 3 vertabraes. Since then I cant be doing to much heavy work, and thats when i decided to do coding since i always found technology amazing. I have been learning and growing how to code for about a year now and I feel ready to start working, and improve with the knowledge the company has to offer.</p>

      <h4>Growth</h4>
      <div class="about-info">
        <p>I started my coding journey in the year 2021. Started taking courses on FreeCodeCamp and ever since I started, I've loved every second of it.I've Learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Node.js, and Linux. I understand the simple stuff in JavaScript, but i want to ge the hang of figuring out algorithms and back-end relevant stuff. </p>

    <div class="about-container">
      <h4>Goal</h4>
      <div class="about-info">
        <p>Before anything i want to land a job as soon as i can in software enginnering to increase my skills and learn from teams. I want to be able to learn a new computer coding or software development program every chance i get. I also want to ensure I have precise project requirements before beginning the project, and I will do this by questioning the relevant parties about their expectations and requirements. It would be great to have optimal communication between myself and my teammates to coordinate all efforts across the board. </p>
